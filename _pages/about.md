I help global enterprises transform technology, processes, and organizations to adapt to and anticipate changes in the technical landscape. As Resident Architect, I partner with executives to understand business and regulatory drivers and translate program goals into courses of action. Specializing in cloud transformation for highly regulated industries, I bring deep technical knowledge to help turn ideas into reality.
